Welcome to my **Advent of Code** solutions repository! 

This project maps my journey through the annual programming puzzles, focusing on **readability**, **clean algorithms**, and exploring language features in **Python** and **Rust**.

> [!NOTE]
> Detailed setup and usage instructions have been moved to [SETUP.md](SETUP.md).
